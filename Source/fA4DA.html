	<h2>A Brief Presentation of the Nine Vehicles</h2>
<p><em><strong>by Alak Zenkar Rinpoche Thubten Nyima</strong></em></p>
<p>Our teacher, the fourth guide of this fortunate aeon, the incomparable lord of sages, ÅÄkyamuni, gave infinite teachings as means to enter the Dharma of the causal and resultant vehicles, in accordance with the particular temperaments, spiritual faculties and attitudes of disciples. Nevertheless, they may all be included within the three vehicles, which, in turn, may be further subdivided into nine successive stages.</p>
<p>As <em>The General SÅ«tra</em> says:<a href="#fn:1" id="fnref:1" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[1]</a> </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate definitive vehicle<br/>
Certainly appears as three in number:<br/>
The vehicles of leading from the origin, Vedic-like asceticism,<br/>
And powerful transformative methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And <em>The Immaculate Confession Tantra</em> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The samayas of the nine successive vehiclesâ<br/>
Three vehicles related to the three piá¹­akas of characteristics,<br/>
The outer three of kriyÄ yoga and so on, related to tantras of asceticism,<br/>
And the inner three yogas related to tantras of skilful methods.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the classification of ânine successive vehicles,â which is found in the Nyingma Early Translation tradition, is made up of:</p>
<ul>
<li>three outer vehicles of leading from the origin [of suffering] or those related to the three piá¹­akas of characteristics,</li>
<li>three inner vehicles of Vedic-like asceticism<a href="#fn:2" id="fnref:2" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[2]</a> or those of the three outer classes of tantra, and</li>
<li>three secret vehicles of powerful transformative methods or those of the three inner classes of tantra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us elaborate a little on the meaning of these, first of all by considering what is meant by the term âvehicleâ or <em>yÄna</em>. It is said in <em>The Condensed SÅ«tra</em>:<a href="#fn:3" id="fnref:3" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[3]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This vehicle is the supreme of vehicles for reaching<br/>
The vast sky-like palace of happiness and bliss.<br/>
Riding in this all beings will reach nirvÄá¹a.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This refers to the literal meaning of the Sanskrit term <em>yÄna</em>, a vehicle or means of conveyance, since it is that which carries us along the paths and bhÅ«mis, bringing us ever greater enlightened qualities.</p>
<h3>I. The Three Outer Vehicles Leading from the Origin</h3>
<p>The three causal vehicles of characteristics are: the ÅrÄvaka vehicle, pratyekabuddha vehicle and bodhisattva vehicle.</p>
<p>Why are these three called âvehicles leading from the originâ? It is because they lead us along the path to the result of liberation from samsara by abandoning all the actions and kleÅas which are the cause or âoriginâ [of suffering].</p>
<h4>1. The ÅrÄvaka Vehicle</h4>
<p>Generally speaking, the Sanskrit word âÅrÄvakaâ has both the meaning of listening and of hearing, so [the Tibetan translation <em>nyenthÃ¶</em> literally means] âlistener-hearer.â Alternatively, the term can be understood to mean âlistening and proclaiming,â in the sense that the ÅrÄvakas rely on masters and then proclaim to others all the words their teachers have spoken.</p>
<p>The initial entry point, the view, the meditation, the conduct and the results of the ÅrÄvaka vehicle will now be explained below.</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>The ÅrÄvakas are motivated by a feeling of renunciation, the wish to escape from all the realms of samsara by themselves alone. With this motivation, they receive one of the seven sets of pratimoká¹£a vows, those of a male or female lay practitioner, novice monk or nun, probationary nun, or fully ordained monk or nun, and having received these vows, they practise moral restraint, keeping their vows unimpaired, repairing any impairments that do occur, and so on.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>As the basis of their path, they determine their view by focusing upon all phenomena included within the five aggregates and realizing that they are devoid of any personal self. They do not understand that all material and conscious phenomena are devoid of true reality, and, asserting a truly real partless particle in perceived objects and an indivisible moment of consciousness, they fail to realize the absence of phenomenal identity.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>In terms of the path, they practise both Åamatha and vipaÅyanÄ meditation. They realize the state of Åamatha by abandoning obstacles and cultivating factors conducive to samÄdhi, according to the nine stages of resting the mind and so on, and generate the wisdom of vipaÅyanÄ by meditating on the sixteen aspects of the four truths.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>They keep to the twelve ascetic practices<a href="#fn:4" id="fnref:4" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[4]</a>Â that avoid the two extreme forms of lifestyle, over-indulgence in sense pleasures<a href="#fn:5" id="fnref:5" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[5]</a>Â and excessive self-punishment.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>They attain any one of eight levels of fruition, corresponding to the degree to which they have abandoned the kleshas of the three realms. There are eight levels because the four results of stream-enterer, once-returner, non-returner and arhat are each divided into the two stages known as the emerging and the established.</p>
<h4>2. The Pratyekabuddha Vehicle</h4>
<p>Pratyekabuddhas, or âself-awakenedâ are so-called because, having a more profound depth of wisdom than the ÅrÄvakas, they manifest their own awakening through the power of their own wisdom, without needing to rely on other masters.</p>
<p>Let us elaborate slightly by presenting the initial entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results of the pratyekabuddha vehicle:</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>As with the entry point to the ÅrÄvaka vehicle, the pratyekabuddhas take up any one of the seven sets of pratimoká¹£a vows and then keep them unimpaired.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>When it comes to the basis of their path, how they determine the view, they realize the absence of a personal self completely, but only realize half the absence of phenomenal identity, because although they realize that the partless particles of perceived objects are not real, they still believe in the true existence of indivisible moments of consciousness.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>When it comes to their path, and their practice of meditation, the uncommon approach of the pratyekabuddhas is to meditate on how the twelve links of interdependent origination arise in their progressive sequence and how they cease in the reverse order.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>Like the ÅrÄvakas, they keep to the twelve rules of ascetic practice.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>As their fruition, those with sharper faculties attain the level of a rhinoceros-like pratyekabuddha arhat and those with duller faculties become parrot-like<a href="#fn:6" id="fnref:6" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[6]</a> pratyekabuddha arhats.</p>
<p>Moreover, they reach their final existence as a result of three specific aspiration prayers. They pray that their last existence may be in a world without buddhas and ÅrÄvakas, that they may attain awakening by themselves, without relying on any teacher, and that they may teach the Dharma silently through physical gestures.</p>
<h4>3. The Bodhisattva Vehicle</h4>
<p>The bodhisattva vehicle is the part of the mahÄyÄna that belongs to the vehicle of characteristics. It is called the vehicle of bodhisattvas because once it has been entered it has the power to lead someone to great enlightenment, because its domain of experience is vast, in terms of its extensive skilful methods and its profound wisdom, because it brings about benefit and happiness, in the higher realms in the short term, and ultimately at the stage of definitive good, and because it carries one to greater and greater qualities as one progresses along the paths and stages. It is called a vehicle of characteristics because it has all the characteristics of a path that is a direct cause for bringing about the ultimate fruition, the level of buddhahood.</p>
<p>I will now a give a brief outline of its initial entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results.</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>The bodhisattvas practise on the basis of their wish to benefit others. They are motivated by bodhicitta, which has as its focus all sentient beings and is characterized by the wish to establish them all at the level of perfect buddhahood, free from the causes and effects of suffering and endowed with all the causes and effects of happiness. With this motivation, they take the bodhisattva vows of aspiration and application in the proper way, through the ritual of either the tradition of Profound View or Vast Conduct. They then observe the points of discipline concerning what should be adopted and abandoned, and heal and purify any impairments.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>Concerning the basis of their path, how they determine the view, if we speak in terms of philosophical tenets, the approach of Mind Only is to assert that outer objects are not real and all phenomena are but the inner mind, and to claim that the self-aware, self-knowing consciousness devoid of dualistic perception is truly real. The approach of the Middle Way is to realize that all phenomena appear in the manner of dependent origination, but are in reality emptiness, beyond the eight extremes of conceptual elaboration.<a href="#fn:7" id="fnref:7" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[7]</a> Through these approaches, on the basis of the explanation of the two levels of reality, they realize completely the absence of any personal self or phenomenal identity.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>Concerning their path and how they practise meditation, the bodhisattvas realize and train in developing their familiarity with the indivisibility of the two levels of reality, and, on the basis of the yogic meditation that unites Åamatha and vipaÅyanÄ, meditate sequentially on the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment while on the path of training.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>They practise the six transcendent perfections for their own benefit and the four means of attraction for the sake of others.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>They attain the level of buddhahood, which is the ultimate attainment in terms of both abandonment and realization since it means abandoning all that has to be eliminated, the two obscurations including habitual traces, and realizing everything that must be realized, included within the knowledge of all that there is and the knowledge of its nature. They accomplish the two types of dharmakÄya for their own benefit and the two types of rÅ«pakÄya for the benefit of others.</p>
<h3>II. The Three Inner Vehicles of Vedic-like Asceticism</h3>
<p>These are the three outer classes of tantra: the vehicle of kriyÄ tantra, the vehicle of caryÄ tantra and the vehicle of yoga tantra.</p>
<p>You might wonder why are these called âvehicles of Vedic-like asceticism.â It is because the three outer classes of tantra stress aspects of ascetic conduct, such as ritual purification and cleanliness, and in this respect they are similar to the Vedic tradition of the brahmins.</p>
<h4>4. The Vehicle of KriyÄ Tantra</h4>
<p>The kriyÄ tantras, or âactionâ tantras, are so-called because they are concerned mainly with external conduct, the practices of ritual purification and cleanliness and so on.</p>
<p>The entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results of this vehicle are as follows:</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>The initial point of entry to the path of secret mantra vajrayana is ripening empowerment, so here one receives the water empowerment, which establishes the potential for ripening into the dharmakaya, and the crown empowerment, which establishes the potential for ripening into the rÅ«pakÄya. Then one keeps the general samayas of the kriyÄ yoga as they are explained in the particular texts themselves.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>In terms of determining the view, the basis of the path, one realizes that the ground of purification, the nature of mind itself, is the wisdom of empty clarity, and is ultimately beyond all extremes of elaboration, such as existing, not existing, appearing or being empty. Then one views the aspects of relative appearance, which are what must be purified, as the characteristics of the completely pure deity.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>As for the path and the way of practising meditation, it centres around the four realities: 1) the reality of oneself, and 2) the reality of the deity, which is practised by means of the six aspects of the deity,<a href="#fn:8" id="fnref:8" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[8]</a> by visualizing oneself as the samaya form and then invoking the wisdom being into the space in front, considering oneself as a servant and the deity as oneâs master. One then focuses upon 3) the reality of the mantra recitation which is the sound, and on the mind and the ground, and meditates upon 4) the reality of concentration, which consists of remaining in the âflame,â continuation of sound and culmination of sound.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>One performs the three kinds of ritual purification,<a href="#fn:9" id="fnref:9" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[9]</a> changes the three types of clothing,<a href="#fn:10" id="fnref:10" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[10]</a> adopts a diet of the three white foods<a href="#fn:11" id="fnref:11" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[11]</a> and practices ritual fasting and mantra recitation.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>In the short term, one becomes a desire realm vidyÄdhara, and ultimately one attains awakening as Vajradhara of one of the three buddha families: of the family of enlightened body, Vairocana, of the family of enlightened speech, AmitÄbha, or of the family of enlightened mind, Aká¹£obhya.</p>
<h4>5. The Vehicle of CaryÄ Tantra</h4>
<p>The vehicle of <em>caryÄ</em> or âconductâ tantra is so-called because it places an equal emphasis on the outer actions of body and speech and the inner cultivation of samÄdhi. It is also called the âtantra of bothâ (<em>ubhaya</em> tantra) because its view conforms with that of yoga tantra, while its conduct is similar to that of kriyÄ.</p>
<p>I will now say a little about its entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results.</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>One is matured by means of the five empowerments, which include the empowerments of the vajra, bell and name in addition to the water and crown empowerments, and then maintains the samayas of caryÄ tantra, as described in the particular texts themselves.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>The view is determined in the same way as in the yoga tantra, so it will be explained below.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>One visualizes oneself as the samaya being and visualizes the wisdom deity, who is regarded as a friend, in front of oneself, and then practises the conceptual meditations on the syllable, mudrÄ and form of the deity, and the non-conceptual meditation on absolute bodhicitta by means of entering, remaining and arising.<a href="#fn:12" id="fnref:12" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[12]</a></p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>The conduct here is the same as in kriyÄ tantra.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>In the short term, one attains the common accomplishments and ultimately one reaches the level of a vajradhara of the four buddha families, i.e., the three mentioned earlier plus the ratna family.</p>
<h4>6. The Vehicle of Yoga Tantra</h4>
<p>The vehicle of yoga tantra is so-called because it emphasizes the inner yogic meditation upon reality, combining skilful means and wisdom.</p>
<p>Its entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results are as follows:</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>Having been matured through the eleven empowermentsâthe five empowerments of the disciples (water, crown, vajra, bell and name) as well as the six empowerments of the master (the empowerment of irreversibility, empowerment of seeing secret reality, authorization, prophecy, confirmation and praising encouragement)âone keeps the samayas as described in the particular texts.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>The ground, the way in which the view is established, is as follows. Ultimately, all phenomena are realised to be clear light, beyond conceptual elaboration. Through the blessing of this, the relative is seen as the deities of the vajradhÄtu.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>One meditates on the yoga of skilful means, visualizing oneself as the deity by means of the five aspects of awakening and the four miraculous things,<a href="#fn:13" id="fnref:13" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[13]</a> and summons the wisdom being, who then dissolves into oneself, and is sealed by means of the four mudrÄs, and so on. There is also the yoga of wisdom, in which one rests in a state in which ultimate non-conceptual wisdom is inseparable from the relative appearance of the deity of the vajradhÄtu.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>One practises ritual purification and cleanliness simply as a support.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>As a worldly attainment, one becomes a celestial vidyÄdhara, and as the supermundane accomplishment, one attains enlightenment in GhanavyÅ«ha, as one of the five buddha families (in addition to the four families previously mentioned, there is also Amoghasiddhiâs buddha family of enlightened activity).</p>
<h3>III. The Three Secret Vehicles of Powerful Transformative Methods</h3>
<p>These are the three inner classes of tantra: the vehicle of mahÄyoga, the vehicle of anuyoga and the vehicle of atiyoga.</p>
<p>You might wonder why are these are called âvehicles of powerful transformative methods.â It is because they include powerful methods for transforming all phenomena into great purity and equalness.</p>
<h4>7. The Vehicle of Tantra MahÄyoga</h4>
<p>The vehicle of mahÄyoga, or âgreat yoga,â is so-called because it is superior to ordinary yoga tantra since all phenomena are realized to be a magical display in which appearance and emptiness are indivisible.</p>
<p>Once again, I will briefly describe its point of entry, view, meditation, action and results.</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>Once oneâs mind has been matured through receiving the ten outer benefiting empowerments, the five inner enabling empowerments and the three secret profound empowerments, one keeps the samayas as they are described in the texts.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>By means of extraordinary lines of reasoning, one establishes and then realizes the indivisibility of the [two] higher levels of reality, according to which the cause for the appearance of the essential nature, the seven riches of the absolute,<a href="#fn:14" id="fnref:14" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[14]</a> is spontaneously present within the pure awareness that is beyond conceptual elaboration, and all relative phenomena naturally appear as the mandala of deities of the three seats.<a href="#fn:15" id="fnref:15" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[15]</a></p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>When it comes to the path and the practice of meditation, the main emphasis is on the generation stage. In the practice of generation stage yoga, one sets up the practice through the three samÄdhis, ensures that the three of purifying, perfecting and ripening are complete within the visualization, and, once the visualization is complete, seals it with the instruction on the four nails securing the life-force. In the practice of the completion stage yoga, one activates the vital points of the vajra body, its subtle energies, essences, luminosity and so on.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>One maintains elaborate, unelaborate and extremely unelaborate conduct.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>In the short term one reaches the four vidyÄdhara levels, which are the results belonging to the path, and finally one gains the ultimate fruition, and reaches the level of the Vajradhara of unity.<a href="#fn:16" id="fnref:16" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[16]</a></p>
<h4>8. The Vehicle of Scriptural Transmission Anuyoga</h4>
<p>The vehicle of anuyoga, or âfollowing yogaâ, is so-called because it mainly teaches the path of passionately pursuing (or âfollowingâ) wisdom, in the realization that all phenomena are the creative expression of the indivisible unity of absolute space and primordial wisdom.</p>
<p>Once again, let us say a little about its point of entry, view, meditation, conduct and results:</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>Oneâs mind is matured through the thirty-six empowerments in which the four riversâouter, inner, accomplishing and secretâare complete, and one keeps the samayas as described in the texts.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>Through logical reasoning one determines that which is to be known, the fact that all phenomena are characterized as being the three mandalas in their fundamental nature, and realizes that this is so.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>Meditation practice here consists of two paths. On the path of liberation one practises the non-conceptual samÄdhi of simply resting in a state that accords with the essence of reality itself, and the conceptual samÄdhi of deity practice, in which one visualizes the mandala of supporting palace and supported deities simply by reciting the mantra of generation. On the path of skilful means one generates the wisdom of bliss and emptiness through the practices of the upper and lower gateways.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>One practises the conduct that is beyond adopting or abandoning in the recognition that all perceptions are but the display of the wisdom of great bliss.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>At the culmination of Anuyogaâs own uncommon five yogas, which are essentially its five paths,<a href="#fn:17" id="fnref:17" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[17]</a> and the ten stages<a href="#fn:18" id="fnref:18" title="see footnote" class="footnote">[18]</a> that are included within these five, one attains the level of Samantabhadra.</p>
<h4>9. The Vehicle of Pith Instruction Atiyoga</h4>
<p>The vehicle of Atiyoga, or âutmost yoga,â is so-called because it is the highest of all vehicles. It involves the realization that all phenomena are nothing other than the appearances of the naturally arising primordial wisdom which has always been beyond arising and ceasing.</p>
<p>The following is a brief explanation of the entry point, view, meditation, conduct and results of this vehicle.</p>
<h4>i. Entry Point</h4>
<p>Oneâs mind is matured through the four âexpressive power of awarenessâ empowerments (<em>rigpÃ© tsal wang</em>), and one keeps the samayas as explained in the texts.</p>
<h4>ii. View</h4>
<p>The view is definitively established by looking directly into the naturally arising wisdom in which the three kÄyas are inseparable: the empty essence of naked awareness beyond the ordinary mind is the dharmakÄya, its cognizant nature is the sambhogakÄya, and its all-pervasive compassionate energy is the nirmÄá¹akÄya.</p>
<h4>iii. Meditation</h4>
<p>The meditation consists of the approach of cutting through resistance to primordial purity (<em>kadak trekchÃ¶</em>), through which the lazy can reach liberation without effort, and the approach of the direct realization of spontaneous presence (<em>lhundrup tÃ¶gal</em>), through which the diligent can reach liberation with exertion.</p>
<h4>iv. Conduct</h4>
<p>The conduct is free from hope and fear and adopting and abandoning, because all that appears manifests as the display of reality itself.</p>
<h4>v. Results</h4>
<p>Perfecting the four visions of the path, one gains the supreme kÄya, the rainbow body of great transference, and attains the level of glorious Samantabhadra, the thirteenth bhÅ«mi known as âUnexcelled Wisdomâ (<em>yeshe lama</em>).</p>
